# CPU_Scheduling_algo_in_c
Here I implemented CPU Scheduling Algorithm using c language
CPU Scheduling is part of Operating Systems's operations.

Algorithms implemented are:
1.First Come First Serve
2.Shortest Job First (Non-preemptive)
3.Shortest Job First (Preemptive) (SRTN)
4.Priority (Non-preemptive)
5.Priority (Preemptive)
6.Round Robin
